# GraphicsEngine
A custom graphics engine for rendering 2D and 3D shapes. The project uses Ray-Tracing algorithm to render 2D and 3D shapes in a virtual scene. The Nvidia CUDA libraries is used to run the algorithm in the GPU and OpenGL is used to display the processed image along with the GLFW libraries in a window. However, for now it is only capable of generating images via the ray tracing algorithm.

###### Language: C++

###### Tools: Visual studio

###### Libraries: OpenGL, Nvidia CUDA
