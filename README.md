# GraphicsEngine
A custom graphics engine for rendering 2D and 3D shapes. The project supports both Ray-Tracing and Rasterization algorithms to render 2D and 3D shapes in a virtual scene. The Nvidia CUDA libraries are used to run the algorithm in the GPU and OpenGL is used to display the processed image along with the GLFW libraries in a window. The project is capable of generating images via both the ray-tracing and rasterization algorithms.

###### Language: C++

###### Tools: Visual studio

###### Libraries: OpenGL, Nvidia CUDA
